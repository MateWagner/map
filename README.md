  1. First you need to have installed a Node JS with NPM Package manager
  2. First need to install with `npm i`
  3. To run the application `npm start`

When the application starts, it will open the page on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if not, then you can click on the link. As the page opens in the center, you will see Veszpr√©m City, and you can move around on the map. When you find your starting point, you can place a marker on the map by double-clicking on the target, and the first target coordinates will show up in a Route Points overlay. You need to have a minimum of two points to start planning a route, and currently, a maximum of three points is passable. After planning the route, it will show up on the map, and it will show the distance and duration of the trip on the bottom of route points overlay.
